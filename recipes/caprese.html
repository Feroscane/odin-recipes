<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a perfect Summer salad. We serve it as a side dish to bbq of tenderloin or skirt steak to balance the beef with lots fresh flavors.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 medium tomatoes, diced</li>
    <li>1 (4 ounce) ball fresh mozzarella, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
    <li>Â¼ cup coarsely chopped fresh basil</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
    <li>41 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 pound flank steak</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 (6.5 ounce) bag butter lettuce mix</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, or to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, 1 clove minced garlic, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl; toss to coat. Cover bowl and refrigerate.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Place steak in a large resealable bag; add 1 clove minced garlic, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and pepper. Seal the bag and distribute the oil mixture over the steak.</li>
    <li>When the grill is preheated, cook steak to your desired degree of doneness, about 5 minutes per side for medium. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes before thinly slicing across the grain.</li>
    <li>Divide lettuce onto 4 serving plates. Drizzle 1 1/2 teaspoons each balsamic vinegar and olive oil onto each lettuce portion. Divide steak and tomato mixture evenly between the salads.</li>
